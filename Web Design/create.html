    <h3>GLASS</h3>
    <p>Glass is an amorphous <i>(non-crystalline)</i> solid. Because it is often transparent and chemically inert,
        glass has found widespread practical, technological, and decorative use in window panes, tableware, and optics.
        Some common objects made of glass are named after the material, e.g., a "glass" for drinking,
           "glasses" for vision correction, and a "magnifying glass".</p>

    <h3>COW</h3>
    <p><b>Cattle</b> <i>(Bos taurus)</i> are large, domesticated, bovid ungulates widely kept as livestock. 
    They are prominent modern members of the subfamily Bovinae and the most widespread species of the genus Bos. 
    Mature female cattle are called cows and mature male cattle are bulls. Young female cattle are called heifers, 
    young male cattle are oxen or bullocks, and castrated male cattle are known as steers.</p>

    <h3>FISH</h3>
    <p style="background-color: white;">A fish is an aquatic, anamniotic, gill-bearing vertebrate animal with swimming fins and a hard skull, 
    but lacking limbs with digits. Fish can be grouped into the more basal jawless fish and the more common jawed fish, 
    the latter including all living cartilaginous and bony fish, as well as the extinct placoderms and acanthodians. 
    In a break from the long tradition of grouping all fish into a single class (''Pisces''),
    modern phylogenetics views fish as a paraphyletic group.</p>
