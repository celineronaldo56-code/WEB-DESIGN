<h3 style="color: blue;"><i> children's cartoon TV </i></h3>
<p>Children's television series<i><b>(or children's television shows)</i></b> are television programs designed specifically for children.
 They are typically characterized by easy-going content devoid of sensitive or adult themes and are normally broadcast during the morning and afternoon when children are awake, 
 immediately before and after school schedules generally start in the country where they air. Educational themes are also prevalent,
  as well as the transmission of cautionary tales and narratives that teach problem-solving methods in some fashion or another, such as social disputes.</p>

<h3 style="color:brown"><i>Animation</i></h3>
<p style="color:azure">Animation is a filmmaking technique whereby still images are manipulated to create moving images. 
 <i><b>In traditional animation, images are drawn or painted by hand on transparent celluloid sheets to be photographed and exhibited on film.</i></b>
 Animation has been recognized as an artistic medium, specifically within the entertainment industry.
  Many animations are either traditional animations or computer animations made with computer-generated imagery (CGI). 
 Stop motion animation, in particular claymation, is also prominent alongside these other forms, albeit to a lesser degree.</p>
